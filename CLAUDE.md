# Date-O-Mat – project notes

Date planner PWA for exactly one couple. Plan and decisions: `docs/PLAN.md`. Setup: `docs/SETUP.md`.

## Conventions

- UI copy is **German**; code, identifiers, comments and commit messages are **English**.
- Time zone is always `Europe/Berlin` (`APP_TIMEZONE` in `src/lib/domain.ts`); use Luxon for date math.
- Pure logic (no DB, no `next/*`) lives in `src/lib` (later `src/core`) and gets Vitest tests next to it.
- Server-only code lives in `src/server` and imports `server-only`.
- Every page/action gets the user via `requireUser()`/`requireCouple()` (`src/server/auth/dal.ts`).
- Cache Components is on: anything reading cookies or the DB must render inside `<Suspense>` in the page.
- Status-like columns are `text` with TS enums from `src/lib/domain.ts` – never Postgres enums.
- Schema change → `npm run db:generate` → commit the SQL in `drizzle/`.
- Mutations are server actions that call `refresh()`; pages that show shared data render `<AutoRefresh />`.
- Google Calendar calls go through `calendarRequest()` (`src/server/google/calendar-api.ts`), which awaits `connection()` first so prefetch/prerender never hits Google. Call `connection()` before any try/catch around live Google data.
- "Now" for a couple is `coupleNow(settings)` (`src/server/clock.ts`), never `new Date()` in round/slot logic – the dev clock shifts it.
- Pages that use time or write round state call `await connection()` right after `requireCouple()`.
- Design tokens are in `src/app/globals.css` (`sticker`, `press` utilities); bright fills use `text-tinte`.
  In dark mode the light fills (`bg-zitrone-soft`, `bg-himbeere` …) reset the color tokens to light values,
  so `text-ink`/`text-muted` on them stay readable – new light fills go into that list.
- Lists of ideas/events filter with the one shared filter (`useIdeaFilter()`, `matchesIdeaFilter()`),
  never with their own chips. New extras go behind `extraOn(settings, …)` and show up only when they fit.

## Checks before pushing
